# dl_theory2
DL theory for multilayers.

# Usage 

Matrix version:
```
python test_multilayer.py --init_std 0.1 --lr 0.2 --seed 433
```

Precise gradient (single sample gradient accumulation, very slow)
```
python test_multilayer.py --init_std 0.1 --lr 0.2 --seed 433 --use_accurate_grad
```

Matrix version to check over-parameterization theorem (should be able to see the second layer relevant weights are zero). 
```
python test_multilayer.py --perturb --node_multi 2 --lr 0.01 --init_std 0.1 --batchsize 1 --seed 232
```

Using existing DL library like PyTorch. Best results (lowest layer all 0.999 in a few iterations, second lowest lots of > 0.95 and other layers also lots of > 0.9):
```
python recon_multilayer.py --data_std 10.0 --node_multi 10 --lr 0.01 --dataset gaussian --d_output 100 --seed 1234
```

Note that 

1. `data_std` needs to be 10 so that the generated dataset will cover corners (if it is 1 then we won't be able to cover all corners and the correlation is low). 

2. It looks like `node_multi = 10` is probably good enough. More `node_multi` makes it slower (in terms of steps) to converge (`lr=0.1` might help).  

3. More supervision definitely helps. It looks like the larger `d_output` the better. `d_output = 10` also works (also all 0.999 in the lowest layer) but not as good as `d_output = 100`.  

4. High `lr` seems to make it unstable. 
5. Add `--normalize` makes it a bit worse (the correlation of second and third layer are not that great).
6. For `MNIST` and `CIFAR10`, we need to make their variance larger (e.g., `(x-0.5)/0.01` for `cifar10` ), so that it covers the space of random networks. Then the network can get recovered.  

Here is some intermediate results:

With `--normalize`, correlation (and error) are worse.
